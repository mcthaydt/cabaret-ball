## Implementation Prompt

---
Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

Implementation Requirements:

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the markdown tracking document and overall progress percentage dynamically.

## Depth Prompt

---

What am I not seeing here? What else should I know?

---

## Audit Prompt

---

Audit all of your work for completeness, consistency, cohesion, and harmony, both within itself and relative to the spec and relative to the codebase. Assume nothing. Verify everything. Investigate any incomplete implementations or incomplete integrations. Do your best work.

---

## Debugging Prompt

---

Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
